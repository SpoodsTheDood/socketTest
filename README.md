# socketTest

**About**
This project was designed as a test for a web socket server. The theme is based around Over the Garden Wall, an early 2010's Autumn cartoon.

**How to Use**
There are two buttons, one that increments the counter and one that resets. Additionally, there is an ability to change your randomly generated name.
